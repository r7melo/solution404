# 🛠️ Batch Image Resizer

## 🔧 Problem

I was always wasting time resizing images one by one to send via email or WhatsApp.

## 💡 Solution

A Python script using the `Pillow` library to resize all images in a folder with a single command.

## ▶️ How to use

1. Install Pillow:  
```bash
pip install pillow
```
